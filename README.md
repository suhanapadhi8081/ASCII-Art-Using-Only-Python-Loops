# Image to ASCII Art Using Python

Project Overview

This project shows how a visual image can be represented using ASCII characters with pure Python logic .

Rather than using any image processing or third party libraries, the program builds an ASCII image manually by assigning characters to specific row and column positions through loops and conditional statements .

The project is designed to help in :
	•	Understanding nested loop structures
	•	Practicing if / elif decision making
	•	Developing pattern based logical thinking
	•	Generating visual output in the terminal


How the Program Works

The ASCII output is generated by treating the terminal as a two dimensional grid with a fixed height and width .
	•	Two nested for loops iterate over each row and column
	•	At every (row, column) coordinate, conditions determine which character should be displayed
	•	ASCII symbols such as . : - = + * # % are used to represent different levels of visual density
	•	The print(character, end='') statement keeps characters on the same line
	•	After each row is completed, a new line is printed to move to the next row

This repeated process forms a complete ASCII representation directly inside the terminal .


Running the Program

Requirements
	•	Python 3.x installed on your system

Execution Steps
	1.	Download or clone the project files
	2.	Open a terminal in the project directory
	3.	Execute the following command :

python ascii_art.py

The generated ASCII art will appear in the terminal window .


This project is suitable for beginners who want to explore how basic programming logic can be used to create structured and visually meaningful output .
